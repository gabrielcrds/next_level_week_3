## Class \#2 notes

1. Components - react makes easy to reuse html in a components fashion.

2. 3 properties of react: components, property and state.
- Already saw the first two
- states are used to store variables that are important for the page being rendered, and are changed by the component.
- states are two things: [variable, function to change variable]
- using this function will cause page to render again

3. Tags “noopener” “noreferrer”
- Used for security in links to external pages
- noopener - a page opnened from a link to a new tab could have some control over the page that opened it. Not with this tag.
- noreferrer - a page could know from which page it was opened. Not with this tag.
